This is a simple line.
This is a follow-up to the simple line.

=== this is an even smaller header

**This is bolded**.
*This is italicized.*
***This is bolded and italicized.***
**This is bolded, but *****this is bolded and italicized.***
**This is bolded, but* this is italicized.*
***This is bitalicized,* this is bolded,* and this is italicized.*
****This is normal,* this is bitalicized,* this is bolded, and* this is italicized.*

this is a new paragraph.

--- this is a quote. don't quote me. actually, *do* quote me.
--- this is immediately after a quote, so the delimiter is treated as just another line.
However, it is converted to a nice-looking double em-dash by convention.
Double-dashes are single em-dashes (--). Triple dashes are double em-dashes (---). And so on.

this comes immediately after.

== Things to do

1) add automatic link parsing
2) add list aliases "[]"
3) add blockquote author field
4) add code block && inline code spans
5) add lists with multiple levels
6) add definitions
7) add tables
8) add hidden spans (with an option to have a placeholder instead of a blackout effect as the "hiding")
9) add dropdown panels with aliases that trigger the dropdown once clicked.
