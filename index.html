this is a simple line.
this is a follow-up to the simple line.

=== this is an even smaller header

**this is bolded**.
*this is italicized.*
***this is bolded and italicized.***
**this is bolded, but *****this is bolded and italicized.***
**this is bolded, but* this is italicized.*
***this is bitalicized,* this is bolded,* and this is italicized.*
****this is normal,* this is bitalicized,* this is bolded, and* this is italicized.*

this is a new paragraph.

--- this is a quote. don't quote me. actually, *do* quote me.
--- this is immediately after a quote, so the delimiter is treated as just another line.
however, it is converted to a nice-looking double em-dash by convention.
double-dashes are single em-dashes (--). triple dashes are double em-dashes (---). and so on.

--- this is another blockquote, though.

this comes immediately after.
www.google.com is a link and appears as a hyperlink.
so do http://www.google.com and http://styles.net.
however, styles.net does not appear as a hyperlink.

hyperlinks can appear with placeholder text.
for instance, www.google.com[this] actually links to www.google.com.
and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)[this text] is a hyperlink to a *Wikipedia* article.

== Things to do

1) add automatic link parsing **done!!**
2) add list aliases "[]"
3) add blockquote author field
4) add code block && inline code spans
5) add lists with multiple levels
6) add definitions
7) add tables
8) add hidden spans (with an option to have a placeholder instead of a blackout effect as the "hiding")
9) add dropdown panels with aliases that trigger the dropdown once clicked.
